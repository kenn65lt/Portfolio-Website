        <p>
        <span>I love playing football.</span> I started playing my sophomore year of my high school.
        Gained several awards throughout my high school football career, I one of the team captains 
        my senior year and All-League honors my junior and senior year. Continued to play my football career after getting offered to continue my academics and football career in Northwestern College, Iowa where I play defensive line. Overall, I love sports, not just football,
        I enjoy watching and playing several sports such as basketball. I believe that my football career helped me with my character, discipline, mental and physical
        toughness which I think gives me the desire and hunger for the career that I want in the IT field.

        <p><span>My love and passion with</span> computers lead me to want to become a software developer. 
           I started programming when  I was a senior in high school, I didn't know nothing about it, 
           I know that the video games I play was created by coding it. The first language I learned was C, however I found that there is vast array of languages out there that I can use better with what interests me. I dove into learning Java by started reading books and Youtube tutorials, then continued learning it in college with the courses I took, however I felt like I learned more throug self-learning which lead me to doubt the value of the courses I am taking. Then I started hearing good things about Udemy courses. I took the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele which is the one of the best Web Development course in Udemy. I started to love web development when I was taking the course, it taught me a lot of useful skills. </p>
